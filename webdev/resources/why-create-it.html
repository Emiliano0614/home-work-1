    <p>Cirillo created the Pomodoro Technique to overcome struggles with focus and productivity. 
        By timing his study sessions with a tomato-shaped kitchen timer, he found that short bursts
         of focused work followed by breaks helped him stay attentive, manage his time better, and avoid burnout. 
         This method has since become a popular tool for people seeking to enhance concentration and productivity.</p>
