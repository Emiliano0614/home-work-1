    <h1>Pomodoro Technique for Studying</h1>
    <p>
        <strong>Studying</strong> is <em>essential</em> because it helps us <strong>absorb, understand</strong>, and <strong>retain knowledge</strong>, which is crucial for academic success and personal growth.
        <em>Effective study habits</em> improve <strong>memory, focus</strong> and <strong>problem-solving skills</strong>, helping us build a strong foundation for future learning.
        By developing the right techniques, like time management and concentration, we can make studying <em>less stressful</em> and <em>more productive</em>, leading
        to better performance and a deeper understanding of what we learn.

        The <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> is a <em>time management</em> method that uses <strong>focused study intervals</strong>, typically <strong>25 minutes</strong> long, followed by a <strong>5-minute break</strong>.
        After four cycles, you take a longer break, usually 15-30 minutes. This technique is highly effective because it breaks work into <em>manageable chunks</em>,
        preventing <em>burnout</em> and enhancing <strong>focus</strong>. By committing to short, intense study sessions, it minimizes distractions and helps maintain <strong>consistent productivity</strong>,
        making studying feel <span class="blue-text">less overwhelming</span> and improving <em>retention</em> over time.
